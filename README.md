# Apache MXNet (Incubating) Examples

This page contains a curated list of awesome Apache MXNet examples, tutorials and blogs. It is inspired by [awesome-php](https://github.com/ziadoz/awesome-php) and [awesome-machine-learning](https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning). See also [Awesome-MXNet](https://github.com/chinakook/Awesome-MXNet) for a similar list.

If you are new to MXNet, please check out the Gluon [60-minute crash course](http://gluon-crash-course.mxnet.io/). Also, [D2L.ai](http://d2l.ai/) offers great materials on deep learning with interactive jupyter notebooks in MXNet, math formula, and a dedicated forum for discussions.
